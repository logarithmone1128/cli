# IM CLI E2E Coverage

## Metrics
- Denominator: 30 leaf commands
- Covered: 12
- Coverage: 40.0%

## Summary
- TestIM_ChatUpdateWorkflow: proves `im +chat-create`, `im +chat-update`, and `im chats get`; key `t.Run(...)` proof points are `update chat name as bot`, `update chat description as bot`, and `get updated chat as bot`.
- TestIM_ChatsGetWorkflow: proves `im chats get` on a fresh chat fixture via `get chat info as bot`.
- TestIM_ChatsLinkWorkflow: proves `im chats link` via `get chat share link as bot`.
- TestIM_ChatMessageWorkflowAsUser: proves the user chat message flow through `create chat as user`, `send message as user`, and `list chat messages as user` with the created message ID and content asserted from read-after-write output.
- TestIM_MessageGetWorkflowAsUser: proves user message readback through `batch get message as user` after creating a fresh chat and sending a unique message.
- TestIM_MessageReplyWorkflowAsBot: proves threaded reply flow through `reply to message in thread as bot` and `list thread replies as bot`, reading back the reply from `im +threads-messages-list`.
- TestIM_MessagesResourcesDownloadDryRun: pins the `im +messages-resources-download` request shape (GET, `/open-apis/im/v1/messages/:message_id/resources/:file_key`, `type=file|image`) and the output-path rejection for absolute and parent-escaping paths, without calling the API.
- TestIM_MessageResourceDownloadWorkflowAsBot: proves `im +messages-resources-download` end to end through `download file resource through the bounded first request` — a 320 KiB fixture is uploaded with `im +messages-send --file`, its `file_key` is read back off the message, and the downloaded bytes are compared byte for byte; the command always sends an initial Range request, but the output does not reveal whether the endpoint answered 206 or 200, so this proves the round trip rather than which path ran. Multi-part continuation is pinned by unit tests. Skips when the test app lacks the IM resource upload scope.
- TestIM_MessagesSendAudioDryRunRejectsNonOpus: proves the `im +messages-send --audio` dry-run validation rejects non-Opus local audio before upload, with typed validation metadata and recovery guidance.
- TestIM_MessageForwardWorkflowAsUser: proves UAT-backed API forwarding through `im messages forward` and `im threads forward` using a fresh message/thread fixture; skips the forward assertions when the current test app/UAT lacks IM forward permission.
- Coverage prerequisite (structured):
  - blocked_case: im.search.stable_fixture_required
  - affected_commands: `im +chat-search`, `im +messages-search`
  - coverage_rule: deterministic search assertions must use stable pre-existing fixtures
  - next_fixture_requirement: stable historical chat/message fixtures
  - replay: see [failure_inventory.md](failure_inventory.md)
